# The-basis-of-ASP.NET
In this repo I contains all materials, which I can find, while learned (and study) the ASP.NET Core. Also I think, that's a nice idea if I will start learn additional technologies and languages, which support me when I'll develop a WEB applications. For example: JavaScript, TypeScript, different kinds of JS frameworks for develop Front-end, also related things such as Angular, React and other.
